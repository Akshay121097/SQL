Below are some of common practices which we must adopt in order to enhance the performance of SQL queries

1. Avoid using * in select clause.
2. Avoid using subqueries instead use cte.
3. Avoid using order by within cte.
4. Always use order by once all the logic is implemented.
5. Apply as much filter conditions as possible while using joins.
6. Avoid using Distinct in minus query as it has inbuilt Distinct functionality.
7. Avoid using IN and NOT IN operator if there is a scope for NULL records.
8. Avoid using WHERE clause while joining tables instead use ON as where creates a Cartesian join
