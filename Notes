There are 'n' number of parameters which impacts the performance and hence the response time of SQL queries fetching you the final result.

Few of the parameters are:

1. Table size

2. Query complexity

3. Concurrent users hitting the same table

4. Buffer memory(RAM)

5. Storage

6.CPU

7.Processing Speed etc.

8. Size of a buffer memory must be sufficient enough to maintain/store active data of your database.



Buffer memory should be of a size that is enough to maintain active data of your database.

If the SQL platform on which you are working is not configured with enough RAM then it will delete the older cache and then new active data/records will be stored in buffer memory.

It also depends on how much minimum and maximum server memory have been configured.



Hope it is clear now !
